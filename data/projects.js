These would later be hidden beneath the new fingerboard section. Strong maple tongues were made, glued in, then pared back flush.", "The missing inlays were cut from mother of pearl and a new fingerboard section was made from a rosewood blank. Once we'd cut the fret slots and the inlay housings, the new inlays were fitted."]

Once the glue had set, the edges were sanded flush with the neck, then the frets were added, levelled and crowned. We then  ebonised the entire fretboard to blend the new section in with the existing. Side dot markers were fitted and a new nut was carved from a solid bone blank. The repaired area on the back of the neck was refinished in a gradated tint to blend into the existing paintwork."]

The new white/black/white layers are added as single strips and scraped back individually. A new heel cap and side infil plates were also made and fitted. All the binding edges were fine sanded for a soft aged look and feel. With the guitar masked up we tint coated the bindings to match the natural patina of the guitars overall look."]
